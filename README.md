# MONIFI

## SETUP
To setup the service, download and run MonifiServiceInstaller.msi. (WARNING: Many antivirus softwares will get upset at you for trying to run this, due to our installer not being signed and published by a verified publisher. Its not much, but its honest work.)

To setup the browser extension, first download or clone the repository. Then go to about:debugging in firefox, click "This Firefox", and then click "Load Temporary Add-On", and select any file in the downloaded repository. The extension should now be loaded! Simply navigate to a youtube video to try it out.

(If the side panel ever disappears, press Control-Shift-Y to bring it back)
